# AI-PROJECT
This is a simple image memorization , image compression AI model.
The image will be stored in the dense layers by gvin the the index values as input and the output will be RGB value from a last dense layer having 3 neurons.
The activation Function used here is sine which provided effective memorization capability to the model.
